\textbf{\textsc{Ongoing:}} 

The {\bf Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE)} is a NASA
infrared-wavelength astronomical space telescope launched in December
2009 and is still operation (as at the time of writing, in its
``NEOWISE-R'' mission phase). WISE performed an all-sky astronomical
survey with images at 3.4, 4.6, 12 and 22$\mu$m using a 40cm (16 in)
diameter infrared telescope in Earth orbit.  {\bf The P.I. is a world
expert in quasar identification using WISE \citep[e.g., ][]{Ross2012,
Ross2015, Timlin2016, Timlin2018} and exploiting mid-infrared light
curve data.} \\

The \textbf{ESA {\emph Gaia}} mission is an ongoing mission to chart a
three-dimensional map the Milky Way, in the process
revealing the composition, formation and evolution of the Galaxy. 
Gaia
is providing unprecedented positional and radial velocity measurements
with the accuracies needed to produce a stereoscopic and kinematic
census of about $\sim$one billion stars in our Galaxy and throughout
the Local Group. 
%This amounts to about 1 per cent of the Galactic stellar population.
