WhilteNot risky.  Current data SDSS
I-IV = 520,000 spectra published; 1,000,000 by 2020 (survey ongoing).

Future:: DESI, ground-based in full construction mode; survey is
starting late 2019) SDSS-V; ground-based; telescope, pipeline,
instrumentation already in place. new surveys start ing 2020 LSST;
ground-based in full construction mode; science survey is starting
2021..)  4MOST; ground-based, in pre construction mode) Euclid, very
muich the most risky programme, since it is space-based, and currently
most likely to slip in schedule. However, although a key ESA facility,
Euclid is arguably the least important of the 5 data streams for our
science case.
