\subsection*{1. Background}

%$  {\bf COLORs....} In your first sentence start by giving some background information to the problem (to set the scene), you can also provide some statistics or financial information i.e. current cost of the disease to the health system, purification of water etc. Follow this by what is the current situation and what your ground breaking solution is to this problem. Does this need a coordinated effort across a number of different disciplines? Also stress here why you are uniquely placed to answer this problem.

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
In the local Universe, there is a link between the key properties of
massive galaxies, such as bulge mass, and their central supermassive
black holes \citep[SMBHs; e.g., ][]{McLure_Dunlop2002, HaringRix2004,
Salviander2007, Greene2010, KormendyHo2013}. This has led to the
proposal that the supermassive black hole, when accreting, has an
influence on its host galaxy by the means of some regulatory
``feedback'' mechanism(s) \citep[e.g., ][]{Sijacki2007, Hopkins2008a,
AlexanderHickox2012, Fabian2012, KingPounds2015}. However, the details
of the physical processes involved in this ``quasar\footnote{We use
the term quasar in a broad sense meaning generally luminous AGN
usually detected in the optical. As we shall see, even the defintion
of `quasar' is now a somewhat unclear term.} feedback'' are still
disputed and, moreover, direct observational evidence for quasar
feedback in the early universe is conspicuous by its absence
\citep[e.g., ][]{HeckmanBest2014, NaabOstriker2017}. Hence, a major
source of uncertainty in our current understanding of galaxy evolution
is how supermassive black holes influence, and potentially regulate,
their host galaxies \citep{Vogelsberger2013, Vogelsberger2014,
Schaye2015, Angles-Alcazar2013, Angles-Alcazar2017}.

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
What is the main quasar triggering mechanism at the height of quasar
activity? What direct observational evidence in individual objects
links quasar activity to star formation?  Can we observe ``quasar feedback''
in action, in situ, for the most luminous sources?  Such unknowns
about the co-evolution of black holes and their host galaxies remain
among the most fundamental unanswered questions in extragalactic
astronomy.  

\smallskip 
\smallskip
\noindent
Furthermore, the details of the physical processes involved in the
quasar activity including how the SMBH directly couples and affects
its most local environment, i.e., the accretion disk, broad line
region and dusty torus, are still unknown at this point
\citep[e.g.,][]{Netzer2015, Padovani2017}.

\smallskip 
\smallskip
\noindent
Although it has long been established that quasars are powered by
accretion discs surrounding supermassive black holes, there have also
been long-standing issues regarding the observed spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) of typical quasars
\citep[e.g.,][]{Koratkar_Blaes1999, Sirko_Goodman2003} differ markedly
from classical predictions \citep[][]{SS73, Pringle1981} with a
typical observed quasar SED flat in $\lambda F_{\lambda}$ over several
decades in wavelength \citep{Elvis1994, Richards2006b}.  Also, real
accretion disks seem to be cooler \cite[e.g., ][]{Lawrence2012} and
larger \cite[e.g.,][]{Pooley2007, Morgan2010, Morgan2012,
Mosquera2011} than the standard accretion disk model predictions.

\smallskip 
\smallskip
\noindent
However, even more troubling are new observations of {\it extreme variability} in some objects - 
factors of several over a decade or so, including, crucially, at optical wavelengths, 
and not just in the extreme UV or in X-rays. This has led to the ``Quasar Viscosity Crisis''
\citep{Lawrence2018}. 

%an accretion disk Recent observations of extreme variability in Active Galactic Nuclei have pushed standard viscous accretion disc models over an edge. "Extreme reprocessing" where an erratically variable central quasi-point source is entirely responsible for heating an otherwise cold and passive low-viscosity disc, may be the best route forward.

\smallskip 
\smallskip
\noindent
As such, we are left in the embarrassing current situation of invoking
galaxy-wide ``quasar feedback'' in order to reconcile demographic
observartions in cosmological-scale simulations, but where we
currently do not understand the physics of mechanism that is supposed
to initiate this necessary and vital energy transport.



\subsubsection*{1.1 Observational State-of-the-Art}
Here we present a concise overview of the observational state-of-the-art 
in quasar studies. 

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
My current research has involved discovering new types of quasars,
which are proving to be the key laboratories in (a) understanding the
physical processes linking accretion disk physics to the host galaxy
and (b) understanding the physical processes linking quasar activity
to the host galaxy and wider galactic environment.  
Quasars are ideal
laboratories and tools for three main lines of investigation: {\rm
(i)} to learn about the physical processes in accretion disks observed
on $\lesssim$year timescales; {\rm (ii)} connecting accreting active
galactic nuclei (quasar) with galaxy evolution and {\rm (iii)} to use
quasars as cosmological probes.

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
%\textbf{\textsc{Changing-Look Quasars:}}
\textbf{\textsc{A microscope for rapid Central Engines:}}
Recently ``Changing-look'' quasars 
\citep[CLQs; ][]{LaMassa2015, Runnoe2016, Ruan2016, Runco2016, MacLeod2016, Yang2017} have been
identified, and are defined to be luminous quasars which have a dramatic
appearance, or disappearance, of their broad emission-line component
on observed-frame month-to-year timescales.  CLQs are important since
they offer a direct observational probe into the physical processes
dictating the structure of the broad-line region (BLR). These
timescales can potentially be associated with the viscous timescale
(the drift time through the accretion disk), the light crossing
timescale (critical for reverberation mapping and disk reprocessing)
and the dynamical timescale of the BLR.  CLQs are thus an ideal
laboratory for studying accretion physics, as the entire system
responds to a large change in ionizing flux on a human timescale.

\smallskip \smallskip
\noindent 
In \citet{MacLeod2016}I co-led the first systematic search for CLQs based on
photometry from SDSS and Pan-STARRS1, along with repeat spectra from
the SDSS/BOSS, and reported the discovery of 10 CLQs. This is a
startling result since we now estimate $\approx$10-15\% of bona fide
quasars may exhibit `changing look' behaviour on $\sim$10 year 
(rest-frame) timescales. However, plausible time-scales for variable
dust extinction are factors of $2-10$ too long to explain the dimming
and brightening in these sources.  Changes in accretion rate are the
currently favored explanation for CLQs, but then the question of how
the inner accretion disk couples to the BLR immediately
arises. Further investigation is thus warranted.

\noindent
\textbf{\textsc{New IR investigations into the CLQ Population:}}
Taking advantage of new optical imaging data from the Dark Energy
Camera Legacy Survey \href{http://legacysurvey.org/decamls/}{(DECaLS)}
and new IR light-curves from NEOWISE \citep{Meisner2017a, Meisner2017b}, we have made further
in-roads into understanding the CLQ population. This includes
identifying objects with rapidly changing IR light-curves and also
accretion disk changes, e.g. the $z=0.378$ quasar SDSS
J110057-005304.4, see Figure~\ref{fig:J110057}. From J110057, my new
model \citep{Ross2018} suggests a dramatic new picture of the physics of the
CLQs governed by processes at the innermost stable circular orbit
(ISCO) and the structure of the innermost disk. {\it We have embarked
on a new observation campaign, gaining optical light-curves (from the
Liverpool Telescope) and spectra (from WHT and Palomar) to test this
startling new hypothesis.}

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
{\bf In summary, as of the time of writing, the
observational state-of-the-art for extreme variable quasars is 44
objects, 11 of which I have either discovered or co-led the
discovery.}

\subsubsection*{1.2 Theoretical State-of-the-Art}
Here we present a consice high-level overview of the theoretical state-of-the-art 
and in particular focus on issues related to our quasar studies. 

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
\textbf{\textsc{Contemporary Accretion Disk theory:}}
At the accretion disk scale (e.g. $\lesssim 10^{3}-10^{6}$ r$_{g}$,
which is $\approx$5$\times$$10^{-3}$ to 5pc for a 10$^{8}$ M$_{\rm
BH}$).
%where $r_{\rm g}=\frac{GM}{c^2}$ and is $\approx$1 A.U. 
%
\citet{JiangYF2014, JiangYF2016} 


\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
\textbf{\textsc{Contemporary Galaxy formation theory:}}
Contemporary cosmological magnetohydrodynamical galaxy formation
simulations take into account a wide range of physical processes, and
use state-of-the-art numerical codes and take weeks to months to run
on the largest supercomputers.  They are incredibily sophisticated
apparatus and allow us to gain deep insight into the physical
processes that drive galaxy formation, including the energy connected
to an accreting central SMBH. \citet{NaabOstriker2017} present an up
to date reivew of the major challenges for galaxy formation theory, 
including the desire to understand the underlying physical processes
that regulate the structure of the interstellar medium, star
formation, and the driving of galactic outflows.

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
Current state-of-the-art cosmologiocal simulations, not limited to, 
but for example, the EAGLE Project \citep{Schaye2015, Crain2015} and
the IllustrisTNG Project \citep{Pillepich2018} employ and track 10s of
billions resolution elements across 100s of megaparsec-cubed volumes.
%%
For EAGLE (e.g. their L100N1504 simulation), the fundamental units of dimensions 
mass (M), length (L) and time (T, i.e. resolution) are
$\sim2\times10^{5}$ for initial baryonic particle mass, 
``softening lengths'' of 0.35-0.7 pkpc; and and time-steps sampling $\sim$1000 years 
($\sim10^{6}$ time-steps across the age of the Universe) 
\footnote{The times are spaced logarithmically in the expansion factor $a$ such that  $\Delta a = 0.005a$.}. 
For the new IllustrisTNG ``TNG100'' model one has
$1.4\times10^{6}$ for baryonic particle mass, 
%Plummer-equivalent gravitational 
softening lengths $\approx$0.2-1 pkpc, and $8\times10^{5} h^{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$ for the seed black hole mass. 
As such, these are extremely powerful for global galactic properties, but these simulations were 
never designed to explicitly address inner central engine physics. 

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
Further powerful progress is made with the new high-resolution ``zoom-in'' galaxy
simulations, 
e.g. Feedback In Realistic Environments \citep[FIRE-2;
][]{Wetzel2016, Hopkins2017} or MUFASA \citep[][]{Dave2016}.
%
In FIRE-2 for example, \citet{Wetzel2016} run a cosmological scale dark-matter-only simulation is run to redshift $z=0$, 
an isolated DM halo is then selected, the particles are traced back to very high, $z=100$ redshift 
and the `convex hull' is regenerated at high resolution (embedded within the full lower-resolution volume). 
%
The fiducial baryonic simulation contains dark
matter, gas, and stars within the zoom-in region, comprising 140
million total particles, with $M_{\rm DM} =3.5\times10^{4} M_{\odot}$ and $M_{\rm gas,initial} = 7070 M_{\odot}$ . 
The dark matter and stars have fixed gravitational softening lengths 
of 20 pc and 4 pc (Plummer equivalent), respectively. 
%comoving at z > 9 and physical there- after. Gas smoothing is fully adaptive (see Hopkins 2015) and is the same for the hydrodynamic kernel and gravitational softening. The smallest gas kernel/softening achieved is hgas = 1.0 pc; the median within the host galaxy and (gaseous) dwarf galaxies is »25 and »60 pc, respectively,  z = 0. These softenings allow us to measure properties like velocity dispersions and dynamical masses at our dwarf galaxies’ half-light radii (r  200 pc) with good resolution (>10 hdm, >40 hstar).12 
In these zoom-ins, particle time-stepping is fully adaptive and the shortest time step achieved is 180 years.
As such, these `zoom-in' simulations are very much on their way to resolving the 
scales, masses and cadences needed in order to successful model e.g. the ``changing look'' quasars. 

%Cosmological (M)HD Simulations
%e.g. AREPO \citep{Springel2010}: moving-mesh code
%Illustris 
%or 

%or SPH/Particle Codes
%(e.g. GADGET-n, GASOLINE, P-SPH)

%GIZMO \citep{Hopkins2015} with
%``meshless finite- mass'' %Rieman solver
%
%MUFASA
%
%or 
%GRID/AMR Codes
%(e.g. RAMSES, 
%for the HORIZON-AGN)

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
However, what is remains very concerning is that even once the 
mass, length and timescales are computionally accessible, {\it we 
currently do not know what physical prescriptions should be 
directed for the central black hole and quasar engines to follow.}


\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
Modelling AGNs in cosmological simulations poses several fundamental
challenges. First, the detailed physical mechanisms of both accretion
on to SMBHs 
%\citep{Hopkins_Quataert2010,  Hopkins_Quataert2011, Angles-Alcazar2013, Gaspari2013, Angles-Alcazar2015, Angles-Alcazar2017, CurtisSijacki2015, CurtisSijacki2016, Emsellem2015, Rosas-Guevara2015} 
and the AGN-gas interaction
%\citep{Huarte-Espinosa2011, Gaibler2012, Cielo2014, Costa2014,  Roos2015, Bieri2017, Hopkins2016} 
are poorly understood, which makes it at present impossible to formulate a `correct' treatment for simulations,

\subsubsection*{1.3 Upcoming Surveys, Instruments and Missions}
\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
Variability studies hold information on otherwise unresolvable regions
in Active Galactic Nuclei (quasar). Population studies of large
samples likewise have been very productive for our understanding of
quasar \citep{Lawrence2016_ASPC}.  These two themes are coming
together in the idea of systematic variability studies of large
samples and the field of observational extragalactic astrophysics is
poised for a fundamental and rapid change.
%%

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
Starting in late 2019, a fleet of new telescopes, instruments and missions are coming 
online over the next few years that will leap-frog the quality and
quantity of data we have available today. Over the course of the next
5-6 years, surveys and missions including the fifth incarnation of the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS-V\footnote{\href{www.sdss.org/future/}{{\tt
www.sdss.org/future/}}}), the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope
(LSST\footnote{\href{lsst.org}{{\tt lsst.org}}}), the Dark Energy
Spectroscopit Instrument (DESI\footnote{\href{desi.lbl.gov}{{\tt

Telescope (4MOST\footnote{\href{4most.eu}{{\tt 4most.eu}}}) survey,
and the ESA {\it Euclid}
mission\footnote{\href{sci.esa.int/euclid/}{{\tt

the launch of the {\it James Webb Space Telescope}
(JWST\footnote{\href{jwst.stsci.edu}{{\tt jwst.stsci.edu}}}).

\textbf{\textsc{Imminient:}}\\

The {\bf Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS):} An ongoing project, currently in its fourth phase, SDSS-IV.  
The P.I. was a leading member of the SDSS-III: Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). 
The fifth generation of Sloan Digital Sky Surveys: SDSS-V will be an all-sky, multi-epoch spectroscopic 
survey, yielding spectra of over 6 million objects during its lifetime. Data taking is due to start in 
2020. Access would be through a USD \$230,000 'buy-in' (which allows access for the P.I. and one PDRAs).  . 
{\it Data Products: Repeat spectra in the North and Southern Hemisphere for 500,000 bright QSOs.} \\

The {\bf Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Survey:} is a 5 year cosmology survey 
that will be conducted on the Mayall 4-meter telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory starting 
in 2019. It uses the 5,000 fiber Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and will obtain optical 
spectra for $\approx$20 million galaxies and quasars. The DESI Survey is starts in late 2019 
and data access is through a USD \$250,000 `buy-in' (which allows access for the P.I. and two PDRAs).  \\
{\it Data Products: Spectra of 1e6 quasars across 14,000 deg$^{2}$ of the Northern Sky.} \\

\textit{\textbf{Euclid}} is an ESA Medium Class mission to map the geometry of the dark Universe.
It aims to understand why the expansion of the Universe is accelerating and what the nature 
of the source responsible for this acceleration (``dark energy'') is. 
%%
The
mission will investigate the distance-redshift relationship and the
evolution of cosmic structures by measuring shapes and redshifts of
galaxies and clusters of galaxies out to redshifts $\sim$2, or equivalently
to a look-back time of 10 billion years. In this way, Euclid will
cover the entire period over which dark energy played a significant
role in accelerating the expansion.
%%
{\it Euclid} is planned for launch in mid-2021. 
%%
{\it Data Products: Very broadband optical and 3 filter near-infrared space-based imaging for 15,000 deg$^2$.} \\

The {\bf Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST)} project will conduct
a 10-year survey of the sky, imaging the full Southern Sky every 3
nights. The LSST survey is designed to address four science areas
(Understanding the Mysterious Dark Matter and Dark Energy; Hazardous
Asteroids and the Remote Solar System; The Transient Optical Sky; The
Formation and Structure of the Milky Way) and is an absolutely unique
facility as far as areal, temporal and wavelength coverage.\\
{\it Data Products: $ugrizY$ broadband optical and near-infrared imaging for 20,000 deg$^2$. 
Images the full Southern Sky every 3 days. } \\

The {\bf 4-metre Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope (4MOST):} is a
fibre-fed spectroscopic survey facility on the VISTA telescope with a
large enough field-of-view to survey a large fraction of the southern
sky. The facility will be able to simultaneously obtain spectra of
2,400 objects distributed over a field-of-view of 4 square degrees.
The initial Galactic and Extragalactic surveys will operate over a
five-year period delivering spectra for $\geq$25 million objects over
$\gtrsim$15,000 deg. 4MOST will commence science operations in
mid-2021 ({\bf TO BE CHECKED!!!}.  {\it Data Products: } \\

The {\it Extended Roentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA)} is the main instrument on the 
Spektr-RG (Spectrum-X-Gamma; SRG, SXG), an international high-energy astrophysics observatory. \\

\underline{Notes:}  4MOST has full access to the full LSST footprint. LSST will overlap half (7,500 deg$^2$) of the {\it Euclid} footprint. \\

\noindent
\textbf{\textsc{Ongoing:}} \\

The {\bf Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE)} is a NASA
infrared-wavelength astronomical space telescope launched in December
2009 and is still operation (in its ``NEOWISE-R'' mission phase as at
the time of writing). WISE performed an all-sky astronomical survey
with images at 3.4, 4.6, 12 and 22$\mu$m using a 40cm (16 in) diameter
infrared telescope in Earth orbit. \\

The {\bf James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)} is a space telescope
developed in coordination among NASA, the European Space Agency, and
the Canadian Space Agency. It is scheduled to be launched in June
2019. The telescope will offer unprecedented resolution and
sensitivity from 0.6 to 27$\mu$m.
%%
JWST is a partnership between NASA, ESA and the Canadian Space Agency.
In particular, ESA's contributions to JWST include (but are not
limited to) the NIRSpec instrument and the Optical Bench Assembly of
the MIRI instrument.  In return for these contributions, ESA gains
full partnership in JWST and secures full access to the JWST
observatory for astronomers from ESA Member States on identical terms
to those of today on the Hubble Space Telescope. European scientists
will be represented on all advisory bodies of the project and will be
expected to win observing time on JWST through a joint peer review
process, backed by an expectation of a minimum ESA share of 15\% of
the total JWST observing time. \\


The \textbf{ESA {\it Gaia}} mission is an ongoing mission to chart a
three-dimensional map of our Galaxy, the Milky Way, in the process
revealing the composition, formation and evolution of the Galaxy. Gaia
is providing unprecedented positional and radial velocity measurements
with the accuracies needed to produce a stereoscopic and kinematic
census of about $\sim$one billion stars in our Galaxy and throughout
the Local Group. This amounts to about 1 per cent of the Galactic
stellar population.

\subsection*{2. Objectives}
%\smallskip \smallskip \noindent
%Some points to keep in mind when include::
%\begin{itemize}
%\item    clearly state why and how the proposed work is novel and important in your field
%\item    what are your objectives,
%\item    What are the key challenges/open questions in your field that need to be answered 
%\item    how will you go about it, clearly explain how you propose to address these questions. 
%\item    what are the expected outcomes?
%\item    explain the impact of your work- if you are successful-, on the research area and beyond and your long term vision.
%\end{itemize}

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
The outstanding issues and novel investigations 
that are pertinent to this proposal are summarised in the Table below. 

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
\input{KeyQs_table}

\iffalse
\smallskip 
\smallskip
\noindent
This proposal has two broad and well-posed goals.  
% \smallskip\smallskip \noindent
First, we aim to
elucidate in detail {\it how the energy directly associated with a
supermassive black holes impacts the universal galaxy population.}  We
will gain a deep understanding into the physical mechanisms related to
central engine black holes; their accretion disk physics, their
dynamics on both human and galactic timescales and the role they might
play in forming, and regulating the galaxy population. 
We will investigate what the observed rapid changes tell us about the SMBH and accretion discs, 
and does ``quasar feedback'' regulate galaxy formation?
{\it Ultimately, we want to discover if there is a missing link between the 
activity on sub-parsec scales that impacts on the galaxy-wide kiloparsec scales.}
These are among the most prescient astrophysical issues of our time, 
and where major breakthroughs are imminent.

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
Second, we will {\it discover brand new extragalactic phenomena.}  By
tapping into the massive and raw discovery space that the new
experiments will open up, there is the highly likely outcome of
discovering something ``brand new''. The LSST will deliver a dataset
so spectacularly different both in sky coverage and time-sampling
coverage, that the Universe would have to be an exceptionally boring
place to not have brand new astronomical objects and astrophysical
phenomena waiting to be discovered.
\fi

\iffalse
\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
We will achieve this by leveraging several of the new, large-scale
surveys that are coming online in the next few years. These critical
observations are made by exploiting the large imaging and
spectroscopic datasets that we will have available from the SDSS-V,
DESI, 4MOST, LSST and ESA {\it Euclid}. {\it Crucially, although these 
projects individually will deliver new state-of-the-art datasets, it is 
our project that will be the first to break down the associated data 
silos and combine these data in order to go beyond the state-of-the-art.}
\fi

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
Our ERC Consolidator grant proposal will radically improve our
understanding of one of the two fundamental energy sources available
to galaxies; that of accretion onto the compact object in the central
engine. We will achieve this by leveraging several of the new,
large-scale surveys that are coming online in the next few years.  The
scope and remit of an ERC Consolidator grant will allow us to combine
these data products in a manner that will not only establish the new
state-of-the-art in extragalactic variable science, {\it it will
establish and kickstart the new field of extragalactic variable
science itself}.  The P.I. is a world-leader in observational quasar
astrophysics, both in terms of survey work and individual object
study.  Our proposal takes astrophysics into the 2020s, going from
single objects samples, to surveys and samples of millions of objects
leveraging these multi-billion Euro/dollar/pound next generation
missions, telescopes and their subsequent datasets.

%\textbf{\textsc{\textcolor{Cerulean}{Maximising Science Returns from European priorities:}}}
\textbf{\textsc{Maximising Science Returns from European priorities:}}
Contemporary astronomy is a multi-national endeavor with many leading
facilites being international collaborations. Although a project, with
similar but much less ambitious science goals and return could be
envisaged at the national level, the full discovery and break-through
nature being described herein only comes to the fore when the data
from the various international collaborations are combined
intelligently.  Critically data from leading European Southern
Observatory (ESO) and European Space Agency (ESA) facilites will play
a pivotal role here.

%\smallskip
%\smallskip
%\noindent
%One main ticket-item will be developing the {\it Event Broker Service} that will interface with the e.g. LSST databases, pipelines and transient stream. This is an already solved problem in many areas of DS and InfoSec, but we require a custom build in order to access  the data streams necessary for our science goals.
