\section*{a. State-of-the-art and Objectives}
%\smallskip \smallskip
\noindent
The objectives for this proposal are: to access and combine several
new state-of-the-art large astronomical datasets; to kick start the
new field of variable extragalactic astrophysics; to create a holistic
theory of accretion disk physics and quasar feedback in galaxy
formation theory, and to discover brand new astronomical phenomena.
Details are given in Table 1.  We stress that the novel and
high-risk/high-gain combination of these new state-of-the-art large
datasets will by design {\it go significantly beyond the
state-of-the-art} and will allow substantial advances in the frontiers
of understanding astrophysical phenomena as well as discovering new
objects.


\subsection*{1. Background}
%\smallskip \smallskip
\noindent
Quasars\footnote{ Historically, ``quasars'' and ``Active Galactic
Nuclei (AGN)'' have described different luminosity/classes of objects,
but here we use these terms interchangeably (with a preference for 
quasar) in recognition of the fact that they both describe accreting
supermassive black holes \citet[e.g.][]{Haardt2016book}.}  are powered by
accretion of material onto supermassive black holes, usually via
accretion disks.
%%
In the local Universe, there is a link between the key properties of
massive galaxies, such as bulge mass, and their central supermassive
black holes \citep[SMBHs; e.g., ][]{McLure_Dunlop2002, HaringRix2004,
Salviander2007, Greene2010, KormendyHo2013}. This has led to the
proposal that the supermassive black hole, when accreting, has an
influence on its host galaxy by the means of some regulatory
``feedback'' mechanism(s) \citep[e.g., ][]{Sijacki2007, Hopkins2008a,
AlexanderHickox2012, Fabian2012, KingPounds2015}. However, the details
of the physical processes involved in this `AGN/quasar feedback' are still
disputed and, moreover, direct observational evidence for quasar
feedback in the early universe is conspicuous by its absence
\citep[e.g., ][]{HeckmanBest2014, NaabOstriker2017}. Hence, a major
source of uncertainty in our current understanding of galaxy evolution
is how supermassive black holes influence, and potentially regulate,
their host galaxies \citep{Vogelsberger2013, Vogelsberger2014,
Schaye2015, Angles-Alcazar2013, Angles-Alcazar2017}.

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
What is the main quasar triggering mechanism at the height of quasar
activity? What direct observational evidence in individual objects
links quasar activity to star formation?  Can we observe ``quasar feedback''
in action, in situ, for the most luminous sources?  Such unknowns
about the co-evolution of black holes and their host galaxies remain
among the most fundamental unanswered questions in extragalactic
astronomy.  

\smallskip 
\smallskip
\noindent
Furthermore, the details of the physical processes involved in the
quasar activity including how the SMBH directly couples and affects
its most local environment, i.e., the accretion disk, broad line
region and dusty torus, are still unknown at this point
\citep[e.g.,][]{Netzer2015, Padovani2017}.

\smallskip 
\smallskip
\noindent
Although it has long been established that quasars are powered by
accretion discs surrounding supermassive black holes, there have also
been long-standing issues regarding the observed spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) of typical quasars
\citep[e.g.,][]{Koratkar_Blaes1999, Sirko_Goodman2003} differ markedly
from classical predictions \citep[][]{SS73, Pringle1981} with a
typical observed quasar SED flat in $\lambda F_{\lambda}$ over several
decades in wavelength \citep{Elvis1994, Richards2006b}.  Also, real
accretion disks seem to be cooler \cite[e.g., ][]{Lawrence2012} and
larger \cite[e.g.,][]{Pooley2007, Morgan2010, Morgan2012,
Mosquera2011} than the standard accretion disk model predictions.

\smallskip 
\smallskip
\noindent
However, even more troubling are new observations of {\it extreme
variability} in some objects - factors of several over a decade or so,
including, crucially, at optical wavelengths, and not just in the
extreme UV or in X-rays. This has led to the ``Quasar Viscosity
Crisis'' \citep{Lawrence2018}. 
%an accretion disk Recent observations of extreme variability in Active Galactic Nuclei have pushed standard viscous accretion disc models over an edge. "Extreme reprocessing" where an erratically variable central quasi-point source is entirely responsible for heating an otherwise cold and passive low-viscosity disc, may be the best route forward.

\smallskip 
\smallskip
\noindent
As such, we are left in the embarrassing current situation of invoking
galaxy-wide ``quasar feedback'' in order to reconcile demographic
observations in cosmological-scale simulations, but where we currently
do not understand the physics of mechanism that is supposed to
initiate this necessary and vital energy transport.



\subsubsection*{1.1 Observational State-of-the-Art}
Here we present a concise overview of the observational state-of-the-art 
in quasar studies. 

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
%\textbf{\textsc{Changing-Look Quasars:}}
\textbf{\textsc{A microscope for rapid Central Engines:}}
Recently ``Changing-look'' quasars \citep[CLQs; ][]{LaMassa2015,
Runnoe2016, Ruan2016, Runco2016, MacLeod2016, Yang2017} have been
identified, and are defined to be luminous quasars which have a
dramatic appearance, or disappearance, of their broad emission-line
component on observed-frame month-to-year timescales.  CLQs are
important since they offer a direct observational probe into the
physical processes dictating the structure of the broad-line region
(BLR). These timescales can potentially be associated with the viscous
timescale (the drift time through the accretion disk), the light
crossing timescale (critical for reverberation mapping and disk
reprocessing) and the dynamical timescale of the BLR.  CLQs are thus
an ideal laboratory for studying accretion physics, as the entire
system responds to a large change in ionizing flux on a human
timescale.

\smallskip \smallskip
\noindent 
In \citet{MacLeod2016} I co-led the first systematic search for CLQs
based on photometry from SDSS and Pan-STARRS1, along with repeat
spectra from the SDSS/BOSS, and reported the discovery of 10
CLQs. This is a startling result since we now estimate
$\approx$10-15\% of bona fide quasars may exhibit `changing look'
behaviour on $\sim$10 year (rest-frame) timescales. However, plausible
time-scales for variable dust extinction are factors of $2-10$ too
long to explain the dimming and brightening in these sources.  Changes
in accretion rate are the currently favored explanation for CLQs, but
then the question of how the inner accretion disk couples to the BLR
immediately arises. Further investigation is thus warranted.

\textbf{\textsc{New IR investigations into the CLQ Population:}}
Taking advantage of new optical imaging data from the Dark Energy
Camera Legacy Survey \href{http://legacysurvey.org/decamls/}{(DECaLS)}
and new IR light-curves from NEOWISE \citep{Meisner2017a, Meisner2017b}, we have made further
in-roads into understanding the CLQ population. This includes
identifying objects with rapidly changing IR light-curves and also
accretion disk changes, e.g. the $z=0.378$ quasar SDSS
J110057-005304.4, see Figure~\ref{fig:J110057}. From J110057, my new
model \citep{Ross2018} suggests a dramatic new picture of the physics of the
CLQs governed by processes at the innermost stable circular orbit
(ISCO) and the structure of the innermost disk. 
%{\it We have embarked n a new observation campaign, gaining optical light-curves (from the Liverpool Telescope) and spectra (from WHT and Palomar) to test this startling new hypothesis.}

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
{\bf In summary, as of the time of writing, the
observational state-of-the-art for extreme variable quasars is 44
objects, 11 of which I have either discovered or co-led the
discovery.}

\subsubsection*{1.2 Theoretical State-of-the-Art}
Here we present a concise high-level overview of the theoretical
state-of-the-art and in particular focus on issues related to our
quasar studies.

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
\textbf{\textsc{Contemporary Accretion Disk theory:}}
The accretion disk scale is $\lesssim 10^{3}-10^{6}$ r$_{g}$,
which is $\approx$5$\times$$10^{-3}$ to 5 pc for a 10$^{8}$ M$_{\rm
BH}$.  
And as \citet{YuanNarayan2014} review, black hole accretion flows can be divided into two broad classes: cold and hot. Cold accretion flows consist of cool optically thick gas and are found at relatively high mass accretion rates. 
Hot accretion flows, are virially hot and optically thin, and occur at lower mass accretion rates. %They are described by accretion solutions such as the advection-dominated accretion flow and luminous hot accretion flow.
%\smallskip \smallskip \noindent
Though how a accretion disk flow transitions between `cold' and `hot', e.g. as the mass flowrate $\dot{m}$ changes, is not well understood, and is an area of current activity. %Contemporary accretion disk theory applies sophisticated numerical techniques, radiative transfer codes and magnetohydrodynamics in order to numerically model the physics invoked on these scales. 
%%
%\smallskip \smallskip \noindent
%For example,  \citet{JiangYF2014, JiangYF2016} calculate the turbulence from MRI without any assumption and radiative transfer, including the iron opacity bump self-consistently based on 3D radiation MHD simulations.


\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
\textbf{\textsc{Contemporary Galaxy formation theory:}}
Contemporary cosmological magnetohydrodynamical galaxy formation
simulations take into account a wide range of physical processes, and
use state-of-the-art numerical codes and take weeks to months to run
on the largest supercomputers.  They are incredibily sophisticated
apparatus and allow us to gain deep insight into the physical
processes that drive galaxy formation, including the energy connected
to an accreting central SMBH. \citet{NaabOstriker2017} present an up
to date reivew of the major challenges for galaxy formation theory,
including the desire to understand the underlying physical processes
that regulate the structure of the interstellar medium, star
formation, and the driving of galactic outflows.

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
Current state-of-the-art cosmological simulations, not limited to,
but for example, the EAGLE Project \citep{Schaye2015, Crain2015} and
the IllustrisTNG Project \citep{Pillepich2018} employ and track 10s of
billions resolution elements across 100s of megaparsec-cubed volumes.
For EAGLE (e.g. their L100N1504 simulation), the fundamental units of
dimensions mass (M), length (L) and time (T, i.e. resolution) are
$\sim2\times10^{5}$ for initial baryonic particle mass, ``softening
lengths'' of 0.35-0.7 pkpc; and and time-steps sampling $\sim$1000
years ($\sim10^{6}$ time-steps across the age of the Universe)
\footnote{The times are spaced logarithmically in the expansion factor
$a$ such that $\Delta a = 0.005a$.}.  For the new IllustrisTNG
``TNG100'' model one has $1.4\times10^{6}$ for baryonic particle mass,
and the Plummer-equivalent gravitational softening lengths
$\approx$0.2-1 pkpc, and $8\times10^{5} h^{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$ for the
seed black hole mass.  As such, these are extremely powerful for
global galactic properties, but these simulations were never designed
to explicitly address inner central engine physics.

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
Further powerful progress is made with the new high-resolution
``zoom-in'' galaxy simulations, e.g. Feedback In Realistic
Environments \citep[FIRE-2; ][]{Wetzel2016, Hopkins2017} or MUFASA
\citep[][]{Dave2016}.  In FIRE-2 for example, \citet{Wetzel2016} run a
cosmological scale dark-matter-only simulation is run to redshift
$z=0$, an isolated DM halo is then selected, the particles are traced
back to very high, $z=100$ redshift and the `convex hull' is
regenerated at high resolution (embedded within the full
lower-resolution volume).  The fiducial baryonic simulation contains
dark matter, gas, and stars within the zoom-in region, comprising 140
million total particles, with $M_{\rm DM} =3.5\times10^{4} M_{\odot}$
and $M_{\rm gas,initial} = 7070 M_{\odot}$ .  The dark matter and
stars have fixed gravitational softening lengths of 20pc and 4pc
(Plummer equivalent), respectively.  In these zoom-ins, particle
time-stepping is fully adaptive and the shortest time step achieved is
180 years.  As such, these `zoom-in' simulations are very much on
their way to resolving the scales, masses and cadences needed in order
to successful model e.g. the ``changing look'' quasars.

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
However, what is remains very concerning is that even once the 
mass, length and timescales are computationally accessible, {\it we 
currently do not know what physical prescriptions should be 
directed for the central black hole and quasar engines to follow.}


\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
For example and as described in detailed in \citet{Weinberger2017},
modelling AGNs in cosmological simulations poses several fundamental
challenges. First, the detailed physical mechanisms of both accretion
on to SMBHs \citep{Hopkins_Quataert2010, Hopkins_Quataert2011,
Angles-Alcazar2013, Gaspari2013, Angles-Alcazar2015,
Angles-Alcazar2017, CurtisSijacki2015, CurtisSijacki2016a,
CurtisSijacki2016b, Emsellem2015, Rosas-Guevara2015} and the AGN-gas
interaction \citep{Huarte-Espinosa2011, Gaibler2012, Cielo2014,
Costa2014, Roos2015, Hopkins2016, Bieri2017} are poorly understood,
which makes it at present impossible to formulate a `correct'
treatment for simulations.  The long-time standard physical mechanism
of Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion, i.e. that of spherical accretion
onto a compact object traveling through the interstellar medium
\citep{Hoyle_Lyttleton1939, Bondi_Hoyle1944, Bondi1952} with the
accretion rate given by $\dot {M}_{\rm Bondi} = \frac{\pi G^{2 }M_{\rm
BH}^{2} \rho }{c_{s}^{3}} $, {\it is known to be a considerable
oversimplification.} \citep[e.g.,][]{Edgar2004}.


\subsubsection*{1.3 Upcoming Surveys, Instruments and Missions}
\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
\citep{Lawrence2016_ASPC} emphasize that variability studies hold
information on otherwise unresolvable regions in quasars. And
population studies of large samples likewise have been very productive
for our understanding of quasar These two themes are coming together
in the idea of systematic variability studies of large samples and
{\it over the next 5 or so years} the field of observational
extragalactic astrophysics is poised for a fundamental and rapid
change.


\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
Starting in late 2019, a fleet of new telescopes, instruments and missions are coming 
online over the next few years that will leap-frog the quality and
quantity of data we have available today. Over the course of the next
5-6 years, surveys and missions including the fifth incarnation of the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS-V\footnote{\href{www.sdss.org/future/}{{\tt
www.sdss.org/future/}}}), the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope
(LSST\footnote{\href{lsst.org}{{\tt lsst.org}}}), the Dark Energy
Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI\footnote{\href{desi.lbl.gov}{{\tt
desi.lbl.gov}}}) survey, the 4-meter Multi-Object Spectroscopic
Telescope (4MOST\footnote{\href{4most.eu}{{\tt 4most.eu}}}) survey,
and the ESA {\it Euclid}
mission\footnote{\href{sci.esa.int/euclid/}{{\tt
sci.esa.int/euclid/}}}, will see first light. Even more imminent is
the launch of the {\it James Webb Space Telescope}
(JWST\footnote{\href{jwst.stsci.edu}{{\tt jwst.stsci.edu}}}).

  Overview of Facilities and Surveys related to this proposal

\end{tcolorbox}

\noindent
\textbf{\textsc{Imminent:}}

The {\bf Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS):} An ongoing project,
currently in its fourth phase, SDSS-IV.  The P.I. was a leading member
of the SDSS-III: Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS).  The
fifth generation of Sloan Digital Sky Surveys: SDSS-V will be an
all-sky, multi-epoch spectroscopic survey, yielding spectra of over 6
million objects during its lifetime. Data taking is due to start in
2020. Access would be through a \euro184,100 `buy-in', which allows
access for the P.I. and one PDRA.  {\it Data Products: Repeat spectra
in the North and Southern Hemisphere for 500,000 bright QSOs.} \\

The {\bf Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Survey:} is a 5
year cosmology survey that will be conducted on the Mayall 4-meter
telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory starting in 2019. It uses
the 5,000 fiber Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and will obtain
optical spectra for $\approx$20 million galaxies and quasars. The DESI
Survey is starts in late 2019 and data access is through a
\euro200,100 `buy-in', which allows access for the P.I. and two PDRAs.
{\it Data Products: Spectra of 1e6 quasars across 14,000 deg$^{2}$ of
the Northern Sky.} \\

\textit{\textbf{Euclid}} is an ESA Medium Class mission to map the
geometry of the dark Universe.  It aims to understand why the
expansion of the Universe is accelerating and what the nature of the
source responsible for this acceleration (``dark energy'') is.  The
mission will investigate the distance-redshift relationship and the
evolution of cosmic structures by measuring shapes and redshifts of
galaxies and clusters of galaxies out to redshifts $\sim$2, or
equivalently to a look-back time of 10 billion years. In this way,
Euclid will cover the entire period over which dark energy played a
significant role in accelerating the expansion.  {\it Euclid} is
planned for launch in mid-2021.  {\it Data Products: Very broadband
optical and 3 filter near-infrared space-based imaging for 15,000
deg$^2$.} \\

The {\bf Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST)} project will conduct
a 10-year survey of the sky, imaging the full Southern Sky every 3
nights. The LSST survey is designed to address four science areas
(Understanding the Mysterious Dark Matter and Dark Energy; Hazardous
Asteroids and the Remote Solar System; The Transient Optical Sky; The
Formation and Structure of the Milky Way) and is an absolutely unique
facility as far as areal, temporal and wavelength coverage.  {\it Data
Products: $ugrizY$ broadband optical and near-infrared imaging for
20,000 deg$^2$.  Images the full Southern Sky every 3 days.} \\

The {\bf 4-metre Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope (4MOST):} is a
fibre-fed spectroscopic survey facility on the VISTA telescope with a
large enough field-of-view to survey a large fraction of the southern
sky. The facility will be able to simultaneously obtain spectra of
2,400 objects distributed over a field-of-view of 4 square degrees.
The initial Galactic and Extragalactic surveys will operate over a
five-year period delivering spectra for $\geq$25 million objects over
$\gtrsim$15,000 deg. 4MOST will commence science operations in
mid-2021. \\ 
% ({\bf TO BE CHECKED!!!}.  {\it Data Products: } \\

The {\bf James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)} is a space telescope
developed in coordination among NASA, the European Space Agency, and
the Canadian Space Agency. It is scheduled to be launched in June
2019. The telescope will offer unprecedented resolution and
sensitivity from 0.6 to 27$\mu$m.
%%
JWST is a partnership between NASA, ESA and the Canadian Space Agency.
In particular, ESA's contributions to JWST include (but are not
limited to) the NIRSpec instrument and the Optical Bench Assembly of
the MIRI instrument.  In return for these contributions, ESA gains
full partnership in JWST and secures full access to the JWST
observatory for astronomers from ESA Member States on identical terms
to those of today on the Hubble Space Telescope. European scientists
will be represented on all advisory bodies of the project and will be
expected to win observing time on JWST through a joint peer review
process, backed by an expectation of a minimum ESA share of 15\% of
the total JWST observing time. \\

The {\bf Extended Roentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array
(eROSITA)} is the main instrument on the Spektr-RG mission, an
international high-energy astrophysics observatory.  Set to launch in
2019 with both high sensitivity and a large FOV, eROSITA will discover as many
new X-ray sources in its first twelve months as are known today, after
more than 50 years of X-ray astronomy.  SDSS-V will provide optical
spectroscopic measurements including
identifications and redshifts, of $\sim$400,000 eROSITA X-ray sources
detected in the first 1.5 years of the all sky survey. 
%(i.e., those to a 0.5–2 keV flux limit of ∼2.5×10−14 erg s−1 cm−2;
%%
This sample will comprise mainly quasars/AGN at high Galactic
latitude, but it will also contain X-ray emitting galaxy clusters and
X-ray-bright stars (such as compact binaries and flaring late-type
stars) in the MW and nearby galaxies. In addition, SDSS-V's BHM will
characterize numerous serendipitous discoveries, extreme and rare
objects, transients, and other peculiar variables found in the eROSITA
survey \citep{Merloni2012}, and expand an optical+X-ray quasar sample
with implications for observational cosmological constraints
\citep[e.g.][]{Risaliti_Lusso2015}. 
%This combination of X-ray discovery and optical characterization will provide a great leap forward in our description of the X-ray sky, and it will reveal the connections between large, statistical populations of X-ray sources and the cosmic structures in which they are embedded.
\\

\underline{Notes:} 4MOST has full access to the full LSST
footprint. LSST will overlap half (7,500 deg$^2$) of the {\it Euclid}
footprint. \\

\noindent
\textbf{\textsc{Ongoing:}} 

The {\bf Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE)} is a NASA
infrared-wavelength astronomical space telescope launched in December
2009 and is still operation (in its ``NEOWISE-R'' mission phase as at
the time of writing). WISE performed an all-sky astronomical survey
with images at 3.4, 4.6, 12 and 22$\mu$m using a 40cm (16 in) diameter
infrared telescope in Earth orbit. \\



The \textbf{ESA {\it Gaia}} mission is an ongoing mission to chart a
three-dimensional map of our Galaxy, the Milky Way, in the process
revealing the composition, formation and evolution of the Galaxy. Gaia
is providing unprecedented positional and radial velocity measurements
with the accuracies needed to produce a stereoscopic and kinematic
census of about $\sim$one billion stars in our Galaxy and throughout
the Local Group. This amounts to about 1 per cent of the Galactic
stellar population.

\subsection*{2. Objectives}
%\smallskip \smallskip \noindent
%Some points to keep in mind when include::
%\begin{itemize}
%\item    clearly state why and how the proposed work is novel and important in your field
%\item    what are your objectives,
%\item    What are the key challenges/open questions in your field that need to be answered 
%\item    how will you go about it, clearly explain how you propose to address these questions. 
%\item    what are the expected outcomes?
%\item    explain the impact of your work- if you are successful-, on the research area and beyond and your long term vision.
%\end{itemize}

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
The outstanding issues and novel investigations 
that are pertinent to this proposal are summarised in the Table below. 

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
\input{KeyQs_table}

\iffalse
\smallskip 
\smallskip
\noindent
This proposal has two broad and well-posed goals.  
% \smallskip\smallskip \noindent
First, we aim to
elucidate in detail {\it how the energy directly associated with a
supermassive black holes impacts the universal galaxy population.}  We
will gain a deep understanding into the physical mechanisms related to
central engine black holes; their accretion disk physics, their
dynamics on both human and galactic timescales and the role they might
play in forming, and regulating the galaxy population. 
We will investigate what the observed rapid changes tell us about the SMBH and accretion discs, 
and does ``quasar feedback'' regulate galaxy formation?
{\it Ultimately, we want to discover if there is a missing link between the 
activity on sub-parsec scales that impacts on the galaxy-wide kiloparsec scales.}
These are among the most prescient astrophysical issues of our time, 
and where major breakthroughs are imminent.

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
Second, we will {\it discover brand new extragalactic phenomena.}  By
tapping into the massive and raw discovery space that the new
experiments will open up, there is the highly likely outcome of
discovering something ``brand new''. The LSST will deliver a dataset
so spectacularly different both in sky coverage and time-sampling
coverage, that the Universe would have to be an exceptionally boring
place to not have brand new astronomical objects and astrophysical
phenomena waiting to be discovered.
\fi

\iffalse
\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
We will achieve this by leveraging several of the new, large-scale
surveys that are coming online in the next few years. These critical
observations are made by exploiting the large imaging and
spectroscopic datasets that we will have available from the SDSS-V,
DESI, 4MOST, LSST and ESA {\it Euclid}. {\it Crucially, although these 
projects individually will deliver new state-of-the-art datasets, it is 
our project that will be the first to break down the associated data 
silos and combine these data in order to go beyond the state-of-the-art.}
\fi

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
Our ERC Consolidator grant proposal will radically improve our
understanding of one of the two fundamental energy sources available
to galaxies; that of accretion onto the compact object in the central
engine. We will achieve this by leveraging several of the new,
large-scale surveys that are coming online in the next few years.  The
scope and remit of an ERC Consolidator grant will allow us to combine
these data products in a manner that will not only establish the new
state-of-the-art in extragalactic variable science, {\it it will
establish and kickstart the new field of extragalactic variable
science itself}.  The P.I. is a world-leader in observational quasar
astrophysics, both in terms of survey work and individual object
study.  Our proposal takes astrophysics into the 2020s, going from
single objects samples, to surveys and samples of millions of objects
leveraging these multi-billion Euro/dollar/pound next generation
missions, telescopes and their subsequent datasets.

%\textbf{\textsc{\textcolor{Cerulean}{Maximising Science Returns from European priorities:}}}
\textbf{\textsc{Maximising Science Returns from European priorities:}}
Contemporary astronomy is a multi-national endeavor with many leading
facilites being international collaborations. Although a project, with
similar but much less ambitious science goals and return could be
envisaged at the national level, the full discovery and break-through
nature being described herein only comes to the fore when the data
from the various international collaborations are combined
intelligently.  Critically data from leading European Southern
Observatory (ESO) and European Space Agency (ESA) facilites will play
a pivotal role here.

%\smallskip
%\smallskip
%\noindent
%One main ticket-item will be developing the {\it Event Broker Service} that will interface with the e.g. LSST databases, pipelines and transient stream.
