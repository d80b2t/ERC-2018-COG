\hline \hline
\multicolumn{2}{c}{{\sc The physics of accretion}} \\ 
%Determine the relationship between the accretion disk around black holes and its hot electron plasma. Understand the interplay of the disk/corona system with matter ejected in the form of winds and outflows. & \\\hline
%%
Investigating ``hot'' and ``cold'' mode accretion in the quasar population; 
determining the rates and timescales, and characterising the Changing Look Quasar (CLQ) population.   &     
Identifying and characterizing  all the CLQs in DESI and SDSS-V  ({\bf Project 1 and 5}).  \\ 
\hline
%Understand the significance of AGN outflows in determining the build-up of galaxies at the epoch when most stars in present day galaxies formed & \\ \hline
Establish the relative importance of major mergers, minor mergers, cold streams and secular evolution 
have towards the growth of SMBHs across cosmic time. & \\ \hline
Establishing the bolometric output and origin of IR emission in the $z\sim2-3$ quasar population & 
MIRI MRS spectroscopy with JWST  ({\bf Project 2}).\\
\hline
Establishing the observational  presence of extreme outflows in the $z\sim2-3$ quasar population & 
MIRI MRS spectroscopy with JWST  ({\bf Projects 3 and 4}).\\

%%
\multicolumn{2}{c}{{\sc Obscured accretion and galaxy formation}} \\
\hline
Establishing the theoretical impact of extreme outflows in the $z\sim2-3$ quasar population & 
Hydro simulation modelling  ({\bf Project 4}.\\
\hline
Probing the inner parsec of the quasar central engine & 
Rapid analysis and response on LSST quasar light curves  ({\bf Project 5}) \\ 
\hline
Establishing the range of SED parameter space the quasars occupy by a multi-wavelength multi-epoch ``truth table dataset'' & 
Building ``The Stripe 82 Rosetta Stone'' (SpIES, SHELA, VICS82, S82X, HSC; repeat optical observations from SDSS, DES; {\bf Project 6}) \\ \hline
%%
Find the physical conditions under which SMBH grew at the epoch when most of the accretion and star formation in the Universe occurred ($z\sim1-4$) & Perform a complete census of AGN out to $z\sim3$ \\ \hline
\multicolumn{2}{c}{{\sc Galaxy-scale feedback}}\\
Understand how the accretion disks around black holes launch winds and outflows and determine how much energy these carry & 
Identifying and characterizing  all the CLQs in DESI and SDSS-V  ({\bf Project 1 and 5}).  \\ 
Quantify the amount of ``Maintenance/Jet/Kinetic'' mode and ``Transition/Radiative/Wind'' mode feedback there is. & 
Identifying and characterizing  all the CLQs in DESI and SDSS-V  ({\bf Project 1 and 5}).  \\
