We will do this by utilizing and combining the firehose of data from several new large surveys that will start to come online from late 2019 onwards.  In doing so, we will learn about one of the two fundamental energy sources available to galaxies (accretion onto the central supermassive black hole) and perform the observational tests to gather the evidence to distinguish between galaxy evolution models and theory.

%{\bfseries \large \textcolor{Cerulean}{Overview}}
\section*{\textcolor{Cerulean}{1. Overview}}
Where do galaxies come from? How do black holes form and grow? And
what is the history, and fate, of the Universe?  These are the
deepest, most fundamental questions in astrophysics and cosmology, and
sets the scene for this proposal.

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
{\it Black holes} are omnipresent in our Universe, and black holes
that are millions to billions of times the mass of our Sun, are
ubiquitously found at the centers of galaxies, including our own Milky
Way.  Initially consider physical oddities, we now strongly suspect
that these central, ``supermassive'' black holes have a profound
affect on the galaxies that they live in. This is not surprising since
the potential energy associated with mass accretion onto a
supermassive black hole is comparable to that generated via the
nuclear fusion in the galaxy's stars.
%%
However, the interaction and the physical processes involved in how
this energy escapes the inner most regions of the galaxy and then
interacts with the gas, dust, stars and dark matter, is currently very
poorly understood theoretically, with observational data giving little
insight on how to make key progress.

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
\underline{{\it The field is poised for a fundamental and rapid
change.}} The first data are now in hand that show changes on human
timescales in external galaxies, with these new field-defining studies
including projects led by the P.I.  Moreover, a fleet of telescopes,
detectors and missions are about to come online over the next few
years that will leap-frog the quality and quantity of data we have
available today. Over the course of the next 5-6 years, surveys and
missions including SDSS-V, LSST, DESI, 4MOST and ESA {\it Euclid} will
see first light. Even more imminent is the launch of the {\it James
Webb Space Telescope}.

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
The current state-of-the-art has a sample of $\approx10^{6}$ objects
with one spectral epoch, or only has single objects with the repeat
spectra (e.g, MacLeod, Ross et al. 2016; Ross et al. 2018).  
We plan to make sure the $\approx10^{6}$ sample have
repeat spectra and in doing so, will kickstart the new field of
Extragalactic Time-Domain Astrophysics.


\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
{\bf This proposal has two broad but well-posed goals.}
First, we aim to elucidate, for the first time, how the energy
directly associated with a supermassive black holes impacts the
universal galaxy population.
%%
Second, will open up and explore the Variable Extragalactic Universe,
bringing to bear the slew of new larget format ``synoptic''
telescopes. Things will go ``bang in the middle of the night''; we
just don't know what they are yet. 
%
%% NS-NS merger (EM signatures in the blue...) ...
%% Unify the four fundamental forces of nature...

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
We will achieve this by leveraging several of the new, large-scale
surveys that are coming online in the next few years.
%%
The goal is to connect the physical mechanisms from sub-parsec to
cosmological scales, and to investigate the physical processes that
link luminous AGN activity and the formation and evolution of massive
galaxies. These critical observations are made by exploiting the large
imaging and spectroscopic datasets that we will have available from
the SDSS-V, DESI, 4MOST, LSST and ESA Euclid.
%%
We ask for the personnel to accomplish these vey ambitious, but
achievable goals, along with the `buy-in' to the facilites we need
access to.  We also ask for the computing and travel support that will
directly enable this research.

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
{\it The scope and
remit of an ERC Consolidator grant will allow us to combine these data
products in a manner that will not only establish the new
state-of-the-art in extragalactic time-domain science, it will
establish and kickstart the new field of extragalactic time-domain 
science itself.}

%\smallskip
%\smallskip
\noindent
\section*{\textcolor{Cerulean}{2. Scientific Background}}
Quasars are extremely bright extragalactic objects powered by gas
falling onto supermassive black holes.  They are detected in optical
surveys, both via their photometric and spectra properties.  Accretion
onto a supermassive black hole is one of two major energy sources
available to a galaxy.  However, we do not know how this energy
escapes the central regions where it is generated, and how it
interacts with the galaxy at large.

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
In the Table below, we summarise the outstanding issues, and our novel investigations. 

\smallskip
\smallskip
\input{KeyQs_table}

%\smallskip
%\smallskip
%\noindent
%Within the next 5 - 6 years a fleet of new surveys will come online. 


\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
During its first phase of operation from 2000–2005, the SDSS obtained spectra 
of 1 million galaxies in local Universe. This dataset has become the {\it de facto} standard 
for understanding the present day galaxy population, and setting a boundary 
condition for all theoretical comparisons. 
%%
{\it The paradigm changing success of the SDSS was due to it having 1e6 objects. 
We desire the same sample size and revolutionary understanding of the quasar 
population as the SDSS had with the $z\sim0.1$ galaxy population.}


\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
Funding this ERC Consolidator grant proposal will radically improve
our understanding of one of the two fundamental energy sources
available to galaxies; that of accretion onto the compact object in
the central engine.
%% 
The P.I. is a world-leader in observational quasar astrophysics, both
in terms of survey work and individual object study.
%%
Our proposal takes astrophysics into the 2020s, going from single
objects samples, to surveys and samples of millions of objects
leveraging these multi-billion Euro/dollar/pound next generation
missions, telescopes and their subsequent datasets.



\section*{\textcolor{Cerulean}{3. The Future is Now: Project in larger context}}
%%  You need to answer 5 key questions: 
%%
%    Why bother? , 
%    What problem are you trying to solve?
%\smallskip
%\smallskip
%\noindent
\textbf{\textsc{\textcolor{Cerulean}{Global Motivation:}}}
At its heart, there are two major motivations for our project.  The
first is to gain a deep understanding into the physical mechanisms
related to central engine black holes; their accretion disk physics,
their dynamics on both human and galactic timescales and the role they
might play in forming, and regulating the galaxy population. These are
among the most prescient astrophysical questions of our time, and in
an area where major breakthroughs are imminent.

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
The importance of this branch of astrophysics is already well
establish in Europe and is a priority for the next two decades. This
is demonstrated by noting that one of the two primary mission goals
for the Advanced Telescope for High-ENergy Astrophysics (ATHENA) is
answering the question ``How do black holes grow and shape the
Universe?''.  ATHENA is ESA's second L-class flagship mission, due for
launch in 2028.

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
The second motivation is the massive, untapped and raw discovery space
that the new experiments will open up, and the likely outcome of
discovering something ``brand new''. It is somewhat tricky to say
specifically what to expect, but the fact that e.g. LSST will deliver
a dataset {\it so spectacularly} different both in sky coverage and
time-sampling coverage, means the Universe would have to be an
exceptionally boring (and unfair!) place to not have a brand new
astronomical object and astrophysical phenomena be discovered.

%% Is this a European priority? , 
%% Could it be solved at a national level? 
\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
\textbf{\textsc{\textcolor{Cerulean}{Maximising Science Returns from European priorities:}}}
Contemporary astronomy is a multi-national endeavor with many leading
facilites being international collaborations. Although a project, with
similar but much less ambitious science goals and return could be
envisaged at the national level, the full discovery and break-through
nature being described herein only comes to the fore when the data
from the various international collaborations are combined
intelligently.  Critically data from leading European Southern
Observatory (ESO) and European Space Agency (ESA) facilites will play
a pivotal role here.

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
Although many of the ``building blocks'' for the the solution are
already available (e.g. open source codes, database infrastructures,
the methodology of catalog creation and combination) no one has yet to
combine the data in the way we envisage. Moreover, the datasets we
desire to deliver our paradigm changing science are only coming online
over the next 5-10 years.


\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
%% Why now? 
%% What would happen if you did not do this now?, 
\textbf{\textsc{\textcolor{Cerulean}{Timing:}}}
{\it The timing for this proposal could not be better or more imperative.} 
The first of the data data ``firehose'' turns on in late 2019, with
the full datastream from our key sources fully online around 2021. 
As such, with two years to use exisiting datasets as testbeds, we 
have the time to ramp-up our efforts, while also being able to 
take advantage of the first data releases of all these new projects.

\textbf{\textsc{\textcolor{Cerulean}{Data Science and Observational Astrophysics:}}}
Data science is a new interdisciplinary field of scientific methods to extract knowledge or insights from data in
various forms, either structured or unstructured. It employs
techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the broad areas
of mathematics, statistics, information science, and computer science,
in particular from the subdomains of machine learning, classification,
cluster analysis, data mining, databases, and visualization.  {\it
Modern day observational astrophysicists are in all but the term data
scientists, and as such, this proposal is inherently

%\section*{\textcolor{Cerulean}{Scientific Background and Motivation}}
\section*{\textcolor{Cerulean}{4. Feasibility, Projects and Methodology}}
%We set out a range of projects in Table~1.

%\subsection*{Feasibility}
%The extended synopsis should provide a concise presentation for the
%scientific proposal, including the feasibility of the project and
%paying particular attention to the ground breaking nature of the
%proposal and how it may open new horizon or opportunities for
%research. Give some background to the project and make sure you
%explain the proposed work in the context of the state of the art.

%\subsection*{P.I.'s Experience and Track Record}
\textbf{\textsc{\textcolor{Cerulean}{P.I.'s Experience and Track Record:}}}
The P.I. has an established track record of managing science teams and groups, e.g., 

\begin{itemize}
\item The P.I. was Chair of the SDSS-III BOSS Quasar Target
Selection team. Once BOSS was successfully running, he became the Chair
of the Quasar Science Working Group. In both roles, he was managing a
group of senior professors, other postdocs and graduate students.
%% \noindent
The scientific yield from the BOSS Quasar Survey was extremely high,
with highlights including: the first detection of baryon acoustic
oscillations at $z>1$; the first detection of baryon acoustic
oscillations using quasars; the first measurements of ``the knee'' of
the $z\sim2.5-3$ and $z=5$ optical quasar luminosity function, and the
discovery of the first ``Changing Look'' Quasar.  BOSS also allowed
the first identification of ``extremely red'' quasars, which are a
unique obscured quasar population with extreme physical conditions
related to powerful outflows. {\it The P.I. either led, or was heavily
involved in, all these projects, and \href{https://tinyurl.com/ycxd8lb6}{over 400 publications} have used
the BOSS Quasar catalogs}.

\item The P.I. spent a considerable amount of time in 2017 working as the
Chief Data Scientist for a San Francisco Bay Area tech start-up. 

\item The P.I. is an STFC Ernest Rutherford Fellow, with a budget of \euro615,000 on award. 


\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Breaking Down The Data Silos}
The biggest obstacle to using advanced data analysis is not skill base or technology; it is simply access to the data.
%%
A data silo is a repository of fixed data that remains under the
control of one department and is isolated from the rest of the
organization, much like grain in a farm silo is closed off from
outside elements. Data silos can have technical or cultural roots.

%https://hbr.org/2016/12/breaking-down-data-silos
\noindent
There is a cost to using data. Behind the glamor of powerful
analytical insights is a backlog of tedious data preparation. Since
the popular emergence of data science as a field, its practitioners
have asserted that 80\% of the work involved is acquiring and
preparing data. Despite efforts among software vendors to create
self-service tools for data preparation, this proportion of work is
likely to stay the same for the foreseeable future, for a couple of
reasons.

\noindent
But there is a bigger and costlier demon that lurks in enterprises. A
demon that can drive up that 80\% and often makes initiatives
impossible: data silos. These silos are isolated islands of data, and
they make it prohibitively costly to extract data and put it to other
uses. They can arise for multiple reasons.
%%
In commercial enterprises, data remained siloed for many reasons, a
major one being of course for monetary gain.  However, in research
environments, and {\it especially in contemporary observational
astrophysics}, the data silos are open, but due to the lack of raw
person-power. 


\subsection*{Algorithms and Methodology}
Our algorithms and methodology is based on the latest machine-learning and data science techniques. 
The Extreme deconvolution \href{http://www.sdss.org/dr14/data\_access/value-added-catalogs/?vac\_id=xdqso/}{`XDQSO' technique}\footnote{\href{https://github.com/xdqso/xdqso}{\tt github.com/xdqso/xdqso}}.

\noindent
\href{http://ogrisel.github.io/scikit-learn.org/sklearn-tutorial/index.html}{\tt
scikit-learn} is a Python module integrating classic machine learning
algorithms in the tightly-knit scientific Python world (numpy, scipy,
matplotlib). It aims to provide simple and efficient solutions to
learning problems, accessible to everybody and reusable in various
contexts: machine-learning as a versatile tool for science and
engineering.  \href{https://github.com/astroML/sklearn\_tutorial}{{\tt

%\href{https://github.com/jakevdp/sklearn\_tutorial}{{\tt https://github.com/jakevdp/sklearn\_tutorial}}\\

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
One main ticket-item will be developing the {\it Event Broker Service}
that will interface with the e.g. LSST databases, pipelines and
transient stream. This is an already solved problem in many areas 
of DS and infosec, but we require a custom build in order to access 
the data streams necessary for our science goals. 


\subsection*{Computing Requirements}
As any half-decent data scientist will tell you, with the availability of 
contemporary cloud based services (both commercial and non-for-profit), 
the infrastructure is essentially already in place for all but the most demanding
of compute tasks. The rate limiting factor, in the vast majority of endevours, is 
the actual data access itself. 

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
The facilites available to me at a institute (e.g. Cullen), university
(e.g. \href{https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/research-support/research-computing/ecdf}{``Edinburgh
Compute and Data Facility''} and at a national
{\href{https://www.hartree.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/home.aspx}{The Hartree Centre} level will all be more than sufficient and utilized.
The rate limiting factor will be how quickly and efficiently we can deploy our codes, 
and analysis, i.e. person-power. 


%\smallskip
%\smallskip
%\noindent
%Why (the ERCs)??\\
%World class science is the foundation of tomorrow’s technologies, jobs and wellbeing\\
%Europe needs to develop, attract and retain research talent\\
%Researchers need access to the best infrastructures\\

%\section*{\textcolor{Cerulean}{Open Innovation, Open Science, Open to the World}}
%\section*{Open Innovation, Open Science, Open to the World}
\subsection*{Open Innovation, Open Science, Open to the World}
Every part of the scientific method is becoming an open, collaborative and participative process. 
The P.I. is an exceptionally strong, longtime and vocal supporter of ``Open Access''. 
All my codes, data\footnote{where I am not breaking current data access agreements}, papers 
and proposals can be found at \href{github.com/d80b2t}{{\tt github.com/d80b2t}}. 
Indeed, this proposal itself is now at that location. 

One of the major research outputs 
of this ERC will be computer code. 
As such, we are already working with the
\href{The Software Sustainability Institute}{\tt https://www.software.ac.uk/}
which was founded to support the UK’s research software community. 
Our software well be developed using the FAIR ideology (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable
\footnote{Wilkinson, MD, Sci Data. 2016 Mar 15;3:160018. doi: 10.1038/sdata.2016.18.}
) 
and will be delivered in a manner which is fully inline 
with ``Open Innovation, Open Science, Open to the World''.
