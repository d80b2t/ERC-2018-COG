\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
{\it Black holes} are omnipresent in our Universe, and black holes
that are millions to billions of times the mass of our Sun, are
ubiquitously found at the centers of galaxies, including our own Milky
Way.  Initially consider physical oddities, we now strongly suspect
that these central, ``supermassive'' black holes have a profound
affect on the galaxies that they live in. This is not surprising since
the potential energy associated with mass accretion onto a
supermassive black hole is comparable to that generated via the
nuclear fusion in the galaxy's stars.
%%
However, the interaction and the physical processes involved in how
this energy escapes the inner most regions of the galaxy and then
interacts with the gas, dust, stars and dark matter, is currently very
poorly understood theoretically, with observational data giving little
insight on how to make key progress.


\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
\underline{{\it The field is poised for a fundamental and rapid
change.}} The first data are now in hand that show changes on human
timescales in external galaxies, with these new field-defining studies
including projects led by the P.I.  Moreover, a fleet of telescopes,
detectors and missions are about to come online over the next few
years that will leap-frog the quality and quantity of data we have
available today. Over the course of the next 5-6 years, surveys and
missions including 
the fifth incranation of the Sloan Digitial Sky Survey (SDSS-V) 
%\footnote{\href{www.sdss.org/future/}{{\tt www.sdss.org/future/}}}), 
the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST\footnote{\href{lsst.org}{{\tt lsst.org}}}), 
the Dark Energy Spectroscopit Instrument (DESI\footnote{\href{desi.lbl.gov}{{\tt desi.lbl.gov}}}) survey, 
the 4-meter Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope (4MOST\footnote{\href{4most.eu}{{\tt 4most.eu}}}) survey, 
and the ESA {\it Euclid} mission\footnote{\href{sci.esa.int/euclid/}{{\tt sci.esa.int/euclid/}}}, 
will see first light. Even more imminent is the launch of the 
{\it James Webb Space Telescope} (JWST\footnote{\href{jwst.stsci.edu}{{\tt jwst.stsci.edu}}}). 

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
{\bf This proposal has two broad but well-posed goals.}
First, we aim to elucidate, for the first time, how the energy
directly associated with a supermassive black holes impacts the
universal galaxy population.  This will open up and explore the
Variable Extragalactic Universe, bringing to bear the slew of new
larget format ``synoptic'' telescopes.
%%
Second, we will discover new extragalactic phenomena. 
Things will go ``bump in the middle of the night''; we
just don't know what they are yet. 

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
We will achieve this by leveraging several of the new, large-scale
surveys that are coming online in the next few years.
%%
The goal is to connect the physical mechanisms from sub-parsec to
cosmological scales, and to investigate the physical processes that
link luminous AGN activity and the formation and evolution of massive
galaxies. These critical observations are made by exploiting the large
imaging and spectroscopic datasets that we will have available from
the SDSS-V, DESI, 4MOST, LSST and ESA Euclid.
%%
We ask for the personnel to accomplish these ambitious, but
achievable goals, along with the `buy-in' to the facilites we need
access to.  We also ask for the computing and travel support that will
directly enable this research.


\medskip
\medskip
\noindent
{\bf{\textcolor{Cerulean}{1. State of the Art.}}}

\noindent
The current state-of-the-art data samples have $\approx$10$^{6}$ objects
with one spectral epoch, or only $\sim$a few objects with repeat
spectra (e.g, MacLeod, Ross et al. 2016; Ross et al. 2018).  
We plan to collate datasets so that the $\approx$10$^{6}$ sample have 
light-curves and repeat spectra and in doing so, will kickstart the new field of
Extragalactic Time-Domain Astrophysics.

\noindent
During its first phase of operation (2000–05), the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS) obtained spectra of 1 million galaxies in the local
Universe. This dataset has become the {\it de facto} standard for
understanding the present day galaxy population, and setting a
boundary condition for all theoretical comparisons.
%%
{\it The paradigm changing success of the SDSS was due to it having 1e6 objects. 
We desire the same sample size and revolutionary understanding of the quasar 
population as the SDSS had with the $z\sim0.1$ galaxy population.}
%%
Our proposal takes astrophysics into the 2020s, going from single
objects samples, to surveys and samples of millions of objects
leveraging these very large scale next generation
missions, telescopes and their subsequent datasets.

\noindent
At its heart, there are two major motivations for our project.  The
first is to gain a deep understanding into the physical mechanisms
related to central engine black holes; their accretion disk physics,
their dynamics on both human and galactic timescales and the role they
might play in forming, and regulating the galaxy population. These are
among the most prescient astrophysical questions of our time, and in
an area where major breakthroughs are imminent.

\noindent
The importance of this branch of astrophysics is already well
establish in Europe and is a priority for the next two decades. This
is demonstrated by noting that one of the two primary mission goals
for the Advanced Telescope for High-ENergy Astrophysics (ATHENA) is
answering the question ``How do black holes grow and shape the
Universe?''.  ATHENA is ESA's second L-class flagship mission, due for
launch in 2028.

\noindent
The second motivation is the massive, untapped and raw discovery space
that the new experiments will open up, and the highly likely outcome
of discovering something ``brand new''. It is somewhat tricky to say
specifically what to expect, but the fact that e.g. LSST will deliver
a dataset {\it so spectacularly} different both in sky coverage and
time-sampling coverage, means the Universe would have to be an
exceptionally boring place to not have brand new astronomical objects
and astrophysical phenomena be discovered.

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
{\it The scope and
remit of an ERC Consolidator grant will allow us to combine these data
products in a manner that will not only establish the new
state-of-the-art in extragalactic time-domain science, it will
establish and kickstart the new field of extragalactic time-domain 
science itself.}





\medskip
\medskip
\noindent
\large
{\bf{\textcolor{Cerulean}{2. Methodology}}}
\normalsize

\noindent
Our proposal contains eight work packages that fall into three broad, 
complemenraty catagories: observational studies of large numbers (millons) 
of objects; high-risk, very high-reward observational studies of a small number 
(10s) of objects; theoretical modeling investigations. Risks and mitigation strategies are
present for each WP. 


\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
\textbf{\textsc{WP1: Build an Event Broker:}} 
The LSST will deliver three levels of data products and
services. ``Level 1'' are the nightly data products and their primary
purpose is to enable rapid follow-up of time-domain events. ``Level
2'' data products are annual and will include well calibrated images
and catalogues. ``Level 3'' are the user-created data product services
that will enable science cases that greatly benefit from co-location
of user processing and/or data within the LSST Archive Center. In
order to access the LSST data for our science needs we will need to
build an {\it event broker}, an intermediary program module that
interacts with primarily the ``Level 3'' data products from the LSST.

\noindent
{\bf WP1 is low-risk, high-reward.} 
The goal of this work is to build an  Event Broker. 
The heavy-industry computing
infrastruture is already being supplied by the LSST Data Access Center
and LSST Corporation. Our task will be to build the event broker in a
timely and robust manner. At the effort level of one PDRA (``PDRA 1'')
and a substatioal committment from the P.I., (NPR) along with the key
personel and algorthim resources at the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh,
there is no element of this which can be deemed high-risk.


\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
\textbf{\textsc{WP2: Quasar Catalogue Generation:}} 
Building the quasar corpus and cataloguing the observational data will
be a large, but vital step in beginning to pursue our science
goals. This catalogue will be the glue that binds the observational
projects together and will have not only the data, but moreover the
metadata to enable the other WPs.

\noindent
{\bf WP2 is low-risk, high-reward.}
This is a full WP, and with the P.I.s (NPR) experience at this
specific task, plus the effort level of one PDRA (``PDRA 2'') there is
no element of this which can be deemed high-risk.


\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
\textbf{\textsc{WP3: Light-Curve and Spectral Analyses:}} 
Following on from the quasar corpus catalogue generation, one key
science output will be the full and detailed light-curve and spectral
analyses of the said catalogue. This will result in the discovery of
light-curve trends with quasar type, new methods to measure black hole
mass and the relatively easy check to see which quasars have become
``changing-look'' objects. This WP will also have a data science/machine learning 
aspect.

\noindent
{\bf WP3 is low-risk, high-reward.} The full Light-Curve and Spectral
Analyses that we envisaged will be a significant amount of work,
leading to a signifcant high-reward science. This particular work
package will be broken down into small projects and the level of two
PDRAs (``PDRA 1'' and ``PDRA 2''), as well as the P.I. (NPR) and a PhD
student (``PhD 1'') will be directed towards this. There is no element
of this which can be deemed high-risk.


\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
\textbf{\textsc{WP4: Quasar Demographic studies:}} 
Another major scientific output that will originate from the quasar
corpus catalogue generation will be the study of the Quasar
Demographics from our datastreams. This is different from WP3 in that
these investigations wont necessarily be tied to the time-domain
aspect of our catalogue, but will be the crucial baseline that we, and
the field in general, will use to compare to the time-depedent
discoveries. Luminosity function, clustering and higher-order
statistics will be made in order to precisely determine the census of
AGN, their environemts, their host galaxy preferences and their
evolution. All these are vital observational tests for galaxy
formation models and theory (see WP6).

\noindent
{\bf WP4 is low-risk, high-reward.}
Similar to WP3, the analyses that we envisaged will be broken down
into small projects and the level of two PDRAs (``PDRA 1'' and ``PDRA
2''), as well as the P.I. (NPR) and a PhD student (``PhD 1'') will be
directed towards this. There is no element of this which can be deemed
high-risk.


\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
\textbf{\textsc{WP5: Accretiod Disk Simulation:}} 


\noindent
{\bf WP5 is low-to-medium-risk, high-reward.}
This will be the lead WP for one PDRA (``PDRA 3'') and a low level of the P.I.'s (NPR) time. We classify it not as fully low-risk, since we envisage some ramp-up time to get our theortical simulations to the level that will match our beyond-the-state-of-the-art 

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
\textbf{\textsc{WP6: AGN Feedback Simulaiton:}} 

\noindent
{\bf WP6 is low-risk, high-reward.}



\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
\textbf{\textsc{WP7: Quasar Catalogue Generation:}} 

\noindent
{\bf WP4 is high-risk, high-reward.}


\textbf{\textsc{WP8: New Object Discovery:}} 

\noindent
{\bf WP8 is medium-risk, exceptionally high-reward.}







\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
%\textbf{\textsc{\textcolor{Cerulean}{Maximising Science Returns from European priorities:}}}
\textbf{\textsc{Maximising Science Returns from European priorities:}}
Contemporary astronomy is a multi-national endeavor with many leading
facilites being international collaborations. Although a project, with
similar but much less ambitious science goals and return could be
envisaged at the national level, the full discovery and break-through
nature being described herein only comes to the fore when the data
from the various international collaborations are combined
intelligently.  Critically data from leading European Southern
Observatory (ESO) and European Space Agency (ESA) facilites will play
a pivotal role here.

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
Although many of the ``building blocks'' for our science are already
available (e.g. open source codes, database infrastructures, the
methodology of catalog creation and combination) no one has yet to
combine the data in the way we envisage. Moreover, the new datasets we
desire to deliver our paradigm changing science are only coming online
over the next 5 or so years.


\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
\textbf{\textsc{\textcolor{Cerulean}{Timing:}}}
{\it The timing for this proposal could not be better or more imperative.} 
The first of the data ``firehoses'' turns on in late 2019, with
the full datastream from our key sources fully online around 2022. 
As such, with two years to use existing datasets as testbeds, we 
have the time to ramp-up our efforts, while also being able to 
take advantage of the initial data releases of all these new projects.

Data science is a new interdisciplinary field of scientific methods to
extract knowledge or insights from data in various forms, either
structured or unstructured. It employs techniques and theories drawn
from many fields within the broad areas of mathematics, statistics,
information science, and computer science, in particular from the
subdomains of machine learning, classification, cluster analysis, data

The P.I. has become a world-leader in the field of extragalactic
quasar observational astrophysics.  Moreover, the University of
Edinburgh is now poised to be an astronomical data centre nexus, with
access to the two largest datasets in our proposal; LSST and {\it
Euclid}.  The P.I. has built their career on this science case, and
has already been a P.I.  of a science group (as part of a
collaboration) with prodigious scientific output (400 published,
peer-reviewed papers and counting).


\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
%\section*{\textcolor{Cerulean}{4. Feasibility, Projects and Methodology}}
\textbf{\textsc{P.I.'s Experience and Track Record:}}
The P.I. has an established track record of managing science teams and groups, e.g., 

\begin{itemize}
\item The P.I. was the Chair
of the SDSS-III:BOSS Quasar Science Working Group, managing a
group of senior professors, other postdocs and graduate students.
The scientific yield from the BOSS Quasar Survey was extremely high 
%with highlights including: the first detection of baryon acoustic
%oscillations at $z>1$; the first detection of baryon acoustic
%oscillations using quasars; the first measurements of ``the knee'' of
%the $z\sim2.5-3$ and $z=5$ optical quasar luminosity function, and the
%discovery of the first ``Changing Look'' Quasar.  BOSS also allowed
%the first identification of ``extremely red'' quasars, which are a
%unique obscured quasar population with extreme physical conditions
%related to powerful outflows. {\it The P.I. either led, or was heavily
%involved in, all these projects, and 
with \href{https://tinyurl.com/ycxd8lb6}{over 400 journal publications} having 
used the BOSS Quasar catalogs and datasets.

\item The P.I. spent a considerable amount of time in 2017 working as the
Chief Data Scientist for a San Francisco Bay Area 
tech start-up\footnote{Due to legal immigration issues, this venture is no longer being pursued.}. 

\item The P.I. is an STFC Ernest Rutherford Fellow, with a budget of \euro615,000 on award. 
\end{itemize}

%\subsection*{Breaking Down The Data Silos}
\textbf{\textsc{Breaking Down The Data Silos}}
%https://hbr.org/2016/12/breaking-down-data-silos The biggest obstacle
to using advanced data analysis is not skill base or technology; it is
simply access to the data.  A data silo is a repository of fixed data
that remains under the control of one department/collaboration and is
isolated from the rest of the world, much like grain in a farm silo is
closed off from outside elements. These silos are isolated islands of
data, and they make it prohibitive to extract data and put it to other
uses. They can arise for multiple reasons. In commercial enterprises,
data remained siloed for monetary gain.  However, in research
environments, and {\it especially in contemporary observational
astrophysics}, the data silos are open, but due to the lack of raw
person-power, still remain uncombined. {\it The combination 
of P.I. and host institute means we are uniquely positioned to 
break down these astro-data silos for massively significant 
science gain.}

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
%\subsection*{Algorithms and Methodology}
\textbf{\textsc{Algorithms}}
Our algorithms and methodology is based on the latest machine-learning and data science techniques. 
This includes the ``extreme deconvolution'' \href{http://www.sdss.org/dr14/data\_access/value-added-catalogs/?vac\_id=xdqso/}{`XDQSO' technique}\footnote{\href{https://github.com/xdqso/xdqso}{\tt github.com/xdqso/xdqso}}.

\noindent
One main ticket-item will be developing the {\it Event Broker Service}
that will interface with the e.g. LSST databases, pipelines and
transient stream. This is an already solved problem in many areas 
of DS and InfoSec, but we require a custom build in order to access 
the data streams necessary for our science goals.

\textbf{\textsc{Computing Requirements:}} 
With the availability of contemporary cloud based services (both
commercial and non-for-profit), the infrastructure is essentially
already in place for all but the most demanding of compute tasks. The
rate limiting factor, in the vast majority of endevours, is (a) data
access and (b) development.

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
The facilites available to me at an institute (e.g. IfA Cullen),
university
(e.g. \href{https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/research-support/research-computing/ecdf}{``Edinburgh
Compute and Data Facility''} and at a national
{\href{https://www.hartree.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/home.aspx}{(The Hartree
Centre)} level will all be sufficient and utilized.  The rate limiting
factor will be how quickly and efficiently we can deploy our codes,
and analysis, i.e. person-power.

%\subsection*{Open Innovation, Open Science, Open to the World}
\textbf{\textsc{Open Innovation, Open Science, Open to the World:}} 
The P.I. is an exceptionally strong, longtime and vocal supporter of ``Open Access''. 
All my codes, data\footnote{where I am not breaking current data access agreements}, papers 
and proposals can be found at \href{github.com/d80b2t}{{\tt github.com/d80b2t}}. 
Indeed, this proposal itself is now at that location. 

\iffalse
One of the major research outputs 
of this ERC will be computer code. 
As such, we are already working with the
\href{The Software Sustainability Institute}{\tt https://www.software.ac.uk/}
which was founded to support the UK’s research software community. 
Our software well be developed using the FAIR ideology (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable
\footnote{Wilkinson, MD, Sci Data. 2016 Mar 15;3:160018. doi: 10.1038/sdata.2016.18.}
) 
and will be delivered in a manner which is fully inline 
with ``Open Innovation, Open Science, Open to the World''.
